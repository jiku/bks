Update:

We need a has_and_belongs_to_many HABTM relationship.
That's to say, we need multiple parent id's.
A tag name should only appear once, but in multiple
contexts.

But since it habtm itself, i.e. to tags, how do we do that?
It's all internal.

----

The current tags-system requires uniqueness of names
regardless of which level they are at.

I'd like to change this so that same-level uniqueness still
applies, but the same tag-name can be used at different
levels.

Also, that when something is at the same "level", but
nested apart from eachother, the name can be the same.

I.e.


Guitar
	Electric
	
Bass
	Electric
	
	
"Electric" should be possible in both places, but
it shouldn't be possible to have

Guitar
	Electric
	Electric
	
or

Guitar
Guitar
	Electric
	

duplicates in that sense.
So, same-level uniqueness still applies.
