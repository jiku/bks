Partial searches for both manufacturers and products
Add search terms (maybe)
Interactive search helper thing



Partial searches for both manufacturers and products:

Necessary. Works only for products (the initial Substruct search function)
thus far.

Add search terms (maybe):

This means that if a manufacturer or product is called A, but is often
referred to as B or C, a person can type in B or C and find A, because there
is a field that relates these search terms to it.
Whether it be a field or some kind of join table (relational table that binds
two other tables together), I'm not sure.
But what about a HM/BT relationship.
I.e. that both a manufacturer and a product has many search_terms, and a
search_term belongs to many manufacturers and products.
Seems easy enough to make?
Then decide whether or not the search function should only search
through these search terms, or these AND products + manufacturers directly,
so you don't HAVE to set up search terms for them.
Even if when creating a product, a default search term with
the same name as the product.name was also created, there would
be duplication, which isn't cool.
It could be just as well to add a field called search_terms to both
the manufacturers and products tables.
It's a bit more obtrusive in one way, since it 'clutters' those tables,
but it would be like that anyhow because of :belongs_to, :has_many + search_term_id, etc.

Interactive search helper thing:

One that gives tips continually like what is already in Substruct
to find product names + what Ryan Bates has done in one of his
tutorials on auto-completion.
