Reviews is a new model and table.
It belongs to both products and users,
meaning a product has many reviews, and a
user has many reviews as well.

Meaning reviews will have two foreign keys,
products_id and users_id.

Rating is just a field in a review.

When viewing a product, do something like

@reviews = Review.Find(:all) where params[:id] == product_id


And when viewing a user

@reviews = Review.Find(:all) where params[:id] == user_id

--

Then in the view, just find some way to make the average rating.
Shouldn't be too hard.

If a review is not about the product, but something else
like the store, then we should excersise our right to remove it.
Have a disclaimer to state this.
